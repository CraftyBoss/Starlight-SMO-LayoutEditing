# Super Mario Odyssey - Custom Layout Tool

This mod introduces edits to Super Mario Odyssey's HUD that allows for users to view any value added by default to the HUD for assistance in various applications. Its main purpose is to demonstrate the ability to modify existing BFLYTs to add Text Panes that can be targeted with the use of the function `al::setPaneString`. 

This repo contains a pre-compiled build of the current source code. It can be downloaded in the [Releases](https://github.com/CraftyBoss/Starlight-SMO-LayoutEditing/releases).

## Prerequisites

- [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) 
- Python 3
- The [Keystone-Engine](https://www.keystone-engine.org/) Python Module

## Building

Build has only been tested on WSL2 running Ubuntu 20.04.1.

Just run:
```

```

On Ubuntu (and other Debian-based systems), devkitPro will be installed to `/opt/devkitpro` by default:

```
