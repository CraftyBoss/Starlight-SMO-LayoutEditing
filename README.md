# Super Mario Odyssey - sead::Textwriter Re-implementation

This mod aims to fully restore use of sead's Textwriter class, which allows for data to be written directly to the viewport using `sead::TextWriter::printf`. To find the example code that this repository contains, navigate to the `debugMenu.cpp` file in source/, which contains functions for creating and using the text writer class (currently the only function that can properly display data to the viewport is `drawMainHook`).

This repo contains a pre-compiled build of the current source code. It can be downloaded in the [Releases](https://github.com/CraftyBoss/Starlight-SMO-LayoutEditing/releases).

## Prerequisites

- [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) 
- Python 3
- The [Keystone-Engine](https://www.keystone-engine.org/) Python Module

## Building

Build has only been tested on WSL2 running Ubuntu 20.04.1.

Just run:
```
DEVKITPRO={path_to_devkitpro} make
```

On Ubuntu (and other Debian-based systems), devkitPro will be installed to `/opt/devkitpro` by default:

```
DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro/ make
```

## Installing (Atmosphère)

After a successful build, simply transfer the `atmosphere` folder located inside `starlight_patch_100` to the root of your switch's SD card.
